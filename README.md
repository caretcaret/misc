*almamater-xkcd* (Apr 2013) :: Haskell program written for the xkcd hash challenge. It successfully calculates the hash of a string made from a subset of characters [A-Za-z0-9.]\*. Does not implement brute-force checking.

*caretbot* (Dec 2012) :: Python irc bot written for xchat. It has a list of triggers and responses; when someone writes the trigger string, caretbot responds with the corresponding response. Users in the channel can change triggers and responses interactively.
