Hypothesis: The number of characters to learn to get partial fluency is:
Let A_0 be the empty set. Define f(X) = number of occurrences of character compounds made from set X and A_i = A_{i-1} \cup argmax_x f(A_i \cup \{x\}). Let g(i) = f(A_i).
Then the number of characters to learn to get intermediate fluency is the end of the first "hump" of dg/di.

Why this data?
The data source were television show subtitles, which more closely matches everyday speech than texts.

Why character compounds?

Suppose there are three characters A, B, C, D with the following compound occurrence rates:

A 40
AB 20
B 0
BC 0
ABC 0
AC 0
C 1
CD 39
ACD 0
ABCD 0
BCD 0
BD 0
ABD 0
AD 0
D 0

The characters have occurrence rates:
A 60
B 20
C 40
D 39

We learn A first, since this gives us A=40 words (more than B=0, C=1, D=0). Should we learn B, C, or D next?
Looking at the character occurrence rates, it looks like we should learn C next. If we learn A and C, but haven't gotten around to learning B or D, we know A=40 and AC=41, which gives us 41%.
By learning B, we can get A=40 and AB=20, which gives us 60%.
